# Problem Statement
Traditional music platforms suffer from opaque royalty distributions and a lack of verifiable ownership for licensing. Artists often lose a significant portion of their earnings to intermediaries, while listeners have no clear on-chain proof of their usage rights, whether for personal or commercial purposes.

## 🎵 Project Overview
**Zeno** is a decentralized royalty and music licensing platform designed to bridge the gap between creators and consumers. Built on a dual-contract architecture, Zeno allows artists to mint Master NFTs for their tracks while enabling a separate licensing market. Listeners can purchase specific, verifiable usage rights (Standard or Enterprise) powered by real-time Chainlink price feeds.

### Key Features:
* **Artist Portal**: Musicians can mint their tracks as NFTs, with assets and metadata stored securely on IPFS via Lighthouse.
* **Tiered Licensing Market**: A marketplace where users can buy "Standard" or "Enterprise" usage rights using ETH, with costs pegged to USD ($1/$20) via live oracles.
* **Transparent Royalties**: Smart contracts ensure that payments go directly to the artist, eliminating the need for centralized distributors.
* **User Library**: A dedicated personal collection view where users can track their owned licenses and download high-quality audio tracks.

## 🛠 Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites
* **Node.js**: v18.x or higher
* **MetaMask**: Or any EIP-1193 compatible wallet
* **Environment**: MongoDB instance for off-chain metadata caching

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the Project**
   ```bash
   git clone [https://github.com/](https://github.com/)[your-username]/zeno.git
   cd zeno




This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
